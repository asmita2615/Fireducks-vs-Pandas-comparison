# Fireducks-vs-Pandas-comparison
## 🔥 FireDucks vs Pandas - Speed Battle on Big Data!
 This project is all about comparing two powerful Python libraries — FireDucks and Pandas — when working with really large datasets 🚀
 
 We created a synthetic dataset with 10 Million Rows 📄 and performed common real-world data operations to see which library performs faster ⚡
 
 ## ✨ What’s Inside?
 * Read Large CSV Files and Filter Data
 
 * GroupBy Operations
 
 * Sorting Data
 
 * Benchmark Runtime Comparison
 
 Simple, clean & realistic operations you’ll find in any data engineering or analytics workflow 💻
 
 ## 🧰 Tech Used
 * Python 🐍
 
 * Pandas 🐼
 
 * FireDucks 🔥🦆
 
 * Matplotlib 📊
